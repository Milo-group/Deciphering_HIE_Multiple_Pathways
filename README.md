This is the GitHub repository for _"Charting the Influence of Deuterium Sources in Site-Selective Hydrogen Isotope Exchange."_

**<ins>For the statistical analysis:</ins>**  
The repository includes `.csv` files and the expected outputs.  
The models were developed using the best-subset selection method, with **ddG** as the response variable and **QÂ²** as the criterion for model ranking.  
To run the code, you can use our **moleculaR** program, available at the following GitHub link:
